# GTA_Combat_Tweaks

This project is to condense a bunch of short GTA AI tweaks, mostly combat-related, into a single ASI mod. Currently it has:

* Police arrests enabled at 2 stars and higher (note: requires datafile edits as well).
* Boat mounted weapons enabled. This can replace BoatWeaponsEnabler.asi, which has been rolled into this mod.
* GTA IV-style wanted search radius. When you are wanted, a circular search radius will appear. If you make it out of that radius without
  being spotted and stay unseen for long enough, your wanted level will disappear. Combined with datafile edits, you can make it so that
  you *have* to escape the search radius to lose a wanted level. **Note:** This is disabled by default, but can be enabled in the INI.
